tidownloadmanager
===========================================

Android module using the built-in Download Manager for file downloads.

Minimum Titanium SDK is 7.0.0.GA  (To still support Android 5)



-------------

**com.kosso.tidownloadmanager**



​    Uses the built-in DownloadManager to download files. 

​    Destination path must be to External Storage. 

​    Events: 'success', 'error' and 'progress'. 

- Contains a 'uid' to determine which is which when downloading multiple files at once. 


- Not decided if this was a good idea yet. ;) 

​    Credit for original code and inspiration to: @m1ga and https://github.com/m1ga/com.miga.downloadmanager 

   

Happy to try and merge this in to that module if needed. 



See example/app.js
